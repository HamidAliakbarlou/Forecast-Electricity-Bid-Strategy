# Enhancing Electricity Market Forecasting (Leveraging Time Series Models by considering Exogenous Variables)

## Project Overview

We aimed to improve the precision of bidding strategy forecasting in Alberta's electricity market by employing time series models. Leveraging generator-level hourly bid data from 2008 to 2022, focusing on bids from one firm (TransAlta), we assessed bid functions, fluctuations, and market volatility. Time series models (AR, ARIMA, SARIMA) with an exogenous variable were utilized to forecast bidding strategies.

## Main Goals

The project involved three primary objectives: enhancing forecasting accuracy, evaluating exogenous variables' impact, and accounting for market structural changes.

•	Enhancing bidding strategy forecasting accuracy using time series models.

•	Evaluating the impact of specific exogenous variables, particularly electricity production capacity, on forecasting models.

•	Accounting for structural changes in the electricity market over time.

## Results and Findings

•	Incorporating Q100 consistently improved models, enhancing forecasting accuracy by 2% to 68%.

•	Proposed models consistently outperformed basic models (Seasonal Naïve), with improvement rates ranging from 10% to over 100%.

## Conclusion

Our tailored approach showcased superior forecasting capabilities, addressing short and medium-term horizons. The strategic selection of representative years and careful consideration of exogenous variables contributed to robust and applicable forecasting methodologies, providing clear insights into electricity market dynamics in Alberta.
